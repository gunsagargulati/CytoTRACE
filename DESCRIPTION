Title: Prediction of single-cell differentiation states with CytoTRACE (Cellular (Cyto) Trajectory Reconstruction Analysis using gene Counts and Expression)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gunsagar Gulati
Maintainer: Gunsagar Gulati <ggulati@stanford.edu>
Description: CytoTRACE is a computational framework that leverages single-cell gene counts, covariant gene expression, and local neighborhoods of transcriptionally similar cells to predict ordered differentiation states from scRNA-seq data. This package predicts the order of cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data.
